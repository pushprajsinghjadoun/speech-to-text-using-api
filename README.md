# speech-to-text-using-api
i make this website to select in Developer Student Clubs selection. but i am not selected.
in this website i use webkitSpeechRecognition API which was launch in 2013 "link-https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2013/01/Voice-Driven-Web-Apps-Introduction-to-the-Web-Speech-API" and i learn how this API work and then i start customizing which i needed. 

Function which i add are given below --
1. add different language which make him to understand different languages.
2. store all conversion in a array to display conversion
3. add copy button which is use to  copy conversion from starting to end 
4. add email button to create email for you.
5. one think add is interesting is when you say stop then it stop recognition. my plan is that when you feel lonely when you start converstion with web. like when you say hello then you get reply by voice "hello sir, what can i do for you " and many-one.
